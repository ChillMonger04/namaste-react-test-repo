<!-- package.json (INSTALL AFTER npm init) is a configuration for our npm, it keeps a track of all the dependencies there versions we are using  -->
<!-- Whereas package.lock.json (INSTALLED AFTER PARCEL) keeps the track of the exact version of dependencies we are using -->
<!-- The node modules -> it contains all the data of npm we have fetched (kind of a database) -->
<!-- Transitive dependency -> it is like we have parcel as a dependency, it will further have its own dependencies -->

<!-- There are 2 types of dependencies that we can install -> Dev and Normal
Dev is mostly used for development production builds and Normal are used for general builds

CARET and TILDE are used in version to automatically update if there is a change in our dependency version -->
